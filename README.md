Roger_the_robotic_crab
======================

Robotics Class Project

Description:

Roger the Robotic Crab was a semester long project that involved teaching a non homogenous robot how to play Allan Alcorn's classic game of PONG!!!

In order for Roger to know how to play pong I had to teach him how to walk, search, track, retreat, and punch while not crossing the boundaries. 

Kinematics, Dynamics, Control Theory, & Vision were involved in the project. 

More specific details will be added here soon!!
